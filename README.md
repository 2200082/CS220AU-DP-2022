# CS220AU Digital Portfolio
## Overview
This GitHub repository is the assignment for the [CS220AU](https://github.com/khofstadter/CS220AU) course in 2022. It demonstrates minimalistic ideas for 

- project management
- web hosting with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) 
- web-design with [Markdown language](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) and
- evaluation with the `assessment.md` and the `dp-checklist.md` files. 

The URL of the website can be found in the sidebar, under 'About'. The homepage uses the information in the `index.md` file.
The research question to be answered with the help of this portfolio is: **How are digital identities connected to existential risks?**
In order to answer this question, this portfolio will look at digital identities, existential risks and their interrelationship.

<br>

## Portfolio items
This portfolio contains the following:

1. **website** exploring digital identities, existential risks and critical thinking.
2. **self-and peer-assessment** using the marking rubric in the `assessment.md` file.
3. **portfolio overview** providing a succinct overview of the portfolio, an outline of completed tasks (Log) and tasks to do (TODO) in this `README.md` file.

After you finish these items, complete the `dp-checklist.md` file, download it and submit it on FASER. (Please keep this file in your repository as well after submitting.) In essence, you need to submit only one file on FASER, this `dp-checklist.md`.
