As the title of this website describes, the following section will focus on the connection between artificial intelligence and politics, as it is becoming increasingly relevant not only in everyday private life, but also in public life. According to the Harward Business Review: "Applications of artificial intelligence to the public sector are broad and growing, with early experiments taking place around the world." (Martinho-Truswell."How AI Could Help the Public Sector". Harvard Business Review. Retrieved)<br><br>
Two key differences can be observed in the existing literature. 
First, if a government is in place, AI can be used within its activities to achieve certain benefits.<br>
Second, the extent to which AI impacts on campaigning, on ... and on .... <br>
### AI in Government
The easier part of AI in politics is the part, where applications with narrow AI are used to simplify administrative tasks.<br>

### AI in Politics and political campaigns
As we could see within several presidential campaigns (Barack Obama, Narendra Modi and Donald Trump), AI can be used as a successful political tool: In order to gain more supporters and therefore, more votes in an election, politicians or their background were studying the peoples' behaviour through AI and thus modified their views. Thus, politicians adapted to the needs of the population based on the knowledge gained through AI, with the aim of reaching more voters.<br>
On the other hand, AI can also be used not only to observe the behaviour of the population and adapt actions to it, but also to specifically influence the behaviour of the population. This can be done, for example, through AI in social media.
