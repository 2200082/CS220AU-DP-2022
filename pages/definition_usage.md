# Definition and Usage of AI
Defining the term artificial intelligence seems to be extremely difficult, as there are [entire papers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1210.1568.pdf) in the literature just defining the term. This shows how complex the whole topic of artificial intelligence is. <br>
It is therefore essential to take a closer look at this topic and, especially in times of digitalisation, to deal more with the complexity, the advantages but also the risks.
<br><br>
**Oxford Languages** has found a relatively simple definition and describes artificial intelligence as: 
> *„the theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks normally requiring human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and translation between languages”.*

[**Accenture**](https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insights/artificial-intelligence-summary-index) describes AI as:
> *“Artificial intelligence is a constellation of many different technologies working together to enable machines to sense, comprehend, act, and learn with human-like levels of intelligence. Maybe that’s why it seems as though everyone’s definition of artificial intelligence is different: AI isn’t just one thing.”*

## Narrow AI vs. General AI
[Accenture](https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insights/artificial-intelligence-summary-index) deeper differentiates between so-called **narrow (or "weak")** AI and **general (or "strong")** AI:
#### Narrow (or "weak") AI
“Most of what we experience in our day-to-day lives is narrow AI, which performs a single task or a set of closely related tasks. Examples include:
- Weather apps
- Digital assistants
- Software that analyzes data to optimize a given business function 

These systems are powerful, but the playing field is narrow: They tend to be focused on driving efficiencies. But, with the right application, narrow AI has immense transformational power—and it continues to influence how we work and live on a global scale.”<br>

#### General (or "strong") AI
“General AI is more like what you see in sci-fi films, where sentient machines emulate human intelligence, thinking strategically, abstractly and creatively, with the ability to handle a range of complex tasks. While machines can perform some tasks better than humans (e. g. data processing), this fully realized vision of general AI does not yet exist outside the silver screen. That’s why human-machine collaboration is crucial — in today’s world, artificial intelligence remains an extension of human capabilities, not a replacement.”

## Usage of AI in the Daily Life
We already encounter AI almost every day without even noticing it. Examples include social media, autonomous vehicles and aircraft, digital assistants, and many more. [Dataconomy.com](https://dataconomy.com/2022/05/artificial-intelligence-in-everyday-life/) have put together a great overview of various applications of AI - the website is definitely worth a visit!<br>
In the following, we will now refer to the applications that can also be found in the field of politics. From this list, these would be: 
##### Social Media
...
##### eCommerce / Marketing
...
##### Google predictive search algorithms
